    <h1 class="headers">Northside Youth Soccer League</h1>
    <h3 class="header-middle">RULES OF PLAY & POLICIES</h3>
    <h4 class="smallheaders">FIFA rules shall govern NYSL play except as modified herein.</h4>

    <br>
    <h2 class="h-3">SPORTSMANSHIP</h2>
    <ol>
        <li class="par"> The common interest that members of the Association share is to inspire
            youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play. Any player,
            coach, team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose behavior
            detracts from this purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless of
            technical soccer background, expertise, accomplishments or standing.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 class="h-3">FIFA FIELD REGULATIONS</h2>

    <ol>
        <li class="para"> 1.DIMENSIONS. FIFA Law 1 provides for flexible external field dimensions
            within a given maximum and minimum width and length. These
            dimensions should be adhered to for all fields used by teams under 12
            and older.</li>
    </ol>
    <ol>
        <li class="para">2. COMPETITION FIELDS. Fields used within the competition program must
            be a minimum of 100 x 60 yards. Leagues, districts or associations
            participating in the state competition program that are unable to provide a
            field that meets these minimum requirements must advise the State
            Competition Board which will assign its Fields Committee to inspect the
            field and recommend to the Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum
            dimensions should be granted. Teams from leagues, districts or
            associations that are unable to provide an acceptable field may be
            required to play all their games away</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 class="h-3">3. FIELDS USED BY YOUNG AGE GROUPS</h2>
    <ol>
        <li class="para">A. U-6 play on a field approximately 20 X 40 yards with no penalty
            areas. Fields for older age groups should be progressively larger.</li>
        <li class="para">B. U-8 plays on a field 40-50 yards in length and 20-30 yards width. </li>
        <li class="para">C. U-10 play on a field 70-80 yards in length and 40-50 yards in width</li>
        <li class="para">D. In addition, fields used by young age groups may have their internal
            dimensions and size of goal similarly modified.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 class="h-3">4. TEAM BENCH AREAS </h3>
    <ol>
        <li class="para">A. Recreation & District Programs
            The decision for team/spectator placement on the field will
            be made by the governing body of that team. A team’s
            bench area shall consist of that area at least one (1) yard
            away from the touchline and extending to twenty yards (20)
            both ways from the halfway line. In the event that field conditions
            requireteam benches to be on the same side of
            the field, a team’s bench area shall consist of that area two
            (2) yards away from the touchline and extending twenty
            yards one (1) way from the halfway line.
            The home team has first choice as to where it wishes to
            locate its bench area. Coaches and substitutes are required
            to remain within their bench area during the game. Parents
            and spectators should occupy the same side of the field as
            the team they are supporting.</li>
    </ol>
    <ol>
        <li class="para">B. State Competition League Only
            Except where it is determined by the referee to be
            impractical, team bench areas shall be along the same
            touchline. Each team bench area shall be located two yards
            outside the touchline, beginning not closer than five yards
            from midfield and extending not further than twenty yards
            from midfield. The home team shall have the right to choose
            the location of its bench area. Coaches and substitutes must
            remain within their team's bench area during the game.
            Parents and spectators must occupy the sideline opposite
            the team bench areas. Supporters of a team must assemble
            on the side of the midfield facing the team bench area of that
            team. There shall be a buffer zone extending ten yards on
            each side of the midfield that may not be occupied by
            parents or spectators. Match officials shall be empowered to
            enforce these provisions and may suspend or terminate
            games in the event that any team, coach, parent, or
            spectator declines to abide by requests from match officials
            to comply with these standards.</li>

    <h3 class="h-3">EQUIPMENT</h3>

        <li class="para">TEAM SIZE. Except as noted below, team rosters shall consist of not less
            than eleven nor more than eighteen players. A team must have at least
            seven (7) players present and able to play before referees are permitted to
            start a sanctioned game. No more than eleven (11) players per team may
            be on the field at any one time during the game</li>
    </ol>
    <ol>
        <li class="para"> SIZE OF AGE GROUP TEAMS. In order to give player’s maximum
            opportunity to develop in the game of soccer, U-6 through U-1O play
            modified rules and size of roster as stated in United States Youth Soccer
            Association (USYSA) rules. It is strongly recommended that U-6 and U-8
            play 4 v 4. UYSA shall not sanction games involving teams under 10 or
            younger unless such games are conducted with not more than eight (8)
            players per side. (National rule 4036 section 2)Recreational/Developmental
            players at other ages or where numbers in
            the playing area are low are strongly encouraged to play small-sided
            games on reduced field size.</li>
    </ol>

            the referee at the conclusion of the match in which the third caution was
            received. That player will be suspended from playing in the next game in
            which the offending participant would otherwise be eligible to participate.
            This process will continue so that for every third yellow card received
            during a playing year, the player will be suspended from playing in the
            next game (after the receipt of a third yellow card) for which the offending
            participate would otherwise be eligible to participate. The referee shall
